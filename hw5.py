##    Two Envelopes problem: Implement a function, called simulateProblem(), 
#that does the game simulation for the two envelopes problem. 
#Run the simulation 10000 times to figure out the empirical (observed) probability
# of gaining more money when switching and gaining more money when sticking to 
# the original choice. Each simulation operates as follows:
#
#First, randomly pick an envelopes configuration out of the two possible 
#    configurations,  (ùê¥,2ùê¥)  or  (2ùê¥,ùê¥) . In the first configuration, 
#    the second envelope has twice the money and in the second configuration,
#    the first envelope has twice the money.
#Next, randomly pick one of the two envelopes.
##Finally, randomly choose to either stick or switch. The program checks if 
#you won (the envelope that picked has more money) or 
#not (the envelope that picked has less money). 
#In case of winning, record if the winning was because of sticking or switching.
#You can perform the random choice as follows, using the np.random.randint() method.
#
#import numpy as np
#print(np.random.randint(2))
#The simulateProblem() function takes no arguments and returns two values, 
#first is a boolean output which is True if you win and False if you lose. 
#In case of a win, the second output is True if the win was due to sticking or 
#the lose was due to switching and False if the win was due to switching or 
#the lose was due to sticking.
#
#Once the method simulateProblem() that does the above steps and 
#returns "sticking",or "switching", depending on the win/loss scenario, 
#run the method 1000 times and count the number of times the win was due to 
#sticking to the pick in Step 2, and number of times the win was due to 
#switching the envelope.
